# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the virtual DOM in React?

Your answer: Ideal or virtual representation of UI that shows up on the screen. 

Researched answer: It is everything you see on the screen, visual representation of the code.

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: No need to type in return.

Researched answer: It returns the last line of the code; don't have to have the keyword return.

3. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Your answer: Ruby by default are accessors and everything is a class; it also uses snake casing. You also do not need a return because it does it implicitly. 

Researched answer: Both are object-oriented languages. Both are interpreted, meaning they're run on the fly rather than compiled into machine code before being run. Both have a rich array of third-party libraries available for download. Both have highly active and engaged communities. Javascript is loosely typed. Ruby is dynamic. Both languages have their unique syntaxes which can take some getting used to if youâ€™re new to either one. However, Ruby uses a more intuitive natural language-like syntax, which makes it easier to read and write and for beginners to pick up.

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Your answer: Allows for different Ruby versions in a computer.

Researched answer: It is a command-line tool which allows you to easily install, manage, and work with multiple ruby environments from interpreters to sets of gems.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Ruby blocks: Ruby blocks are anonymous functions that can be passed into methods.

2. RSpec: RSpec is a computer domain-specific language testing tool written in the programming language Ruby to test Ruby code. It is a behavior-driven development framework which is extensively used in production applications.

3. Test-driven development: Test-driven development is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.
